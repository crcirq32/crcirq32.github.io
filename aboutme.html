<h2><center>About Myself</h2></center>
    <p><font size="2" class="Times">
      I went to college in 2009 to study Biochemistry. I enjoyed my undergraduate research, I had the opprounity to synthesize Au-Nanoparticles in environments with adjusted variables.
      In 2013, I received a BS in Biochemistry, shortly after I obtained a career at a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant.
<br><br>
      I quit my job as a chemist. The saying "If you enjoy what you do, you will never work a day in your life," really hit home to me.	I enjoyed working at the plant but not what I was doing. I wanted to fix problems, I wanted to be an engineer.
