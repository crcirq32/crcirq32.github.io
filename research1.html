        <u><font size=3><font=arial>Hosting vs Domain name<br></u><br>
        * In order to create a website, you need to purchase a Web Domain name (www.XYZ.com), as well as server space inorder to put the website online for others to view.<br><br>
        * There are very cheap options for the web domain names, <a href"https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy.com has many options as well as hosting services. <br><br>
        * Another great option, that is even free (although, requires more work) is Github.io. They allow you to post a domain on their servers as well as give you server space. It is free!<br><br>
        * Another cheap option would be AWS. They have very cheap options that are indicative of traffic.<br><br>
        * You must make sure the service comes with an SSL/TSL certificate, this will allow for the verification of your site with hardware.<br><br>
